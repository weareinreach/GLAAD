It wasn't until I was in my 40s that I realized I could express how I felt inside. I discovered communities online that were just like me. A lifetime of confusion, unhappiness, repression, oppression melted away. I discovered words to match my identity: non-binary transmasculine lesbian. I proudly wear these words and my pronouns. I started a new job a year and a half ago so I could begin a new chapter not hiding who I am. My company supports and respects me. They have made extra effort to alter official company paperwork to match my identity.  I still feel waves of happiness every time I am addressed by proper pronouns. I have a wife who loves me for exactly who I am. The second half of my life is going to be amazing!",
		"q9": "Discovering online communities of those who felt similarly to me was the key. I had no reference to understanding of my identity. Growing up and living in a very fundamentalist, conservative community, there were zero examples of LGBTQ people and any inclination to be other than cishet was suppressed. Reddit in particular was central to exploring my identity. Finding new doctors who were gender-affirming became critical. My endocrinologist endorsing testosterone therapy has helped me fully embrace my identity. I have yet to decide whether to pursue top surgery, but I know I have the support network in place if that time comes."

It was my opportunity to imagine a world where I could be trans without knowing that’s what I was doing.",
		"q9": "I’ve gotten most of my resources, support, and community from following various transmascs on Instagram. I get to see so many different people be transmasc in so many different ways and it expanded my understanding of what it could mean to be transmasc, especially how I could reclaim my effeminate qualities as extensions of my masculinity."

It took me years to figure out why.\nThe cuts were always styled for \"girls\" or \"women.\" Even as a queer person that didn't fit me. Fast forward to 2018 - I had been questioning my gender identity when I took the plunge and made an appointment at a gender-inclusive salon. It's hard enough for me to find someone who can style my curly hair much less in a gender-affirming way but I lucked out big time. Looking in the mirror after the cut almost made me cry because for the first time I felt like myself. I later came across the term trans masculine which fit, well, to a T.",
		"q9": "I am incredibly grateful to have been able to access gender-affirming care in many ways for the past few years. I saw a therapist that helped me work through my gender identity concerns and later I decided to start low-dose testosterone. I am also part of a large discord server with trans masculine people and trans men in/around their 30s which has helped a lot, too."

There, hugging my partner with a big grin on my face, was the first time I looked up and saw a man in the mirror. It was the first time that I felt like my transition was really going somewhere. \n\nBeing able to see myself as a man has filled in some of the blank spots in my future. It is easier to imagine a life moving forward when I feel like myself in my own dreams.",
		"q9": "Have a small group of transgender and queer friends has helped a lot, especially early on when I really needed someone to bounce ideas off of.\n\nMy incredibly supportive cisgender partner, who identifies as mostly gay and demisexual, has been with me since only a few months after coming out. In a conversation where I was describing some of the medical elements of transition, he saw that I was nervous about his perception of me changing for the worse. So, he told me “Why would I have any issues with my boyfriend becoming actively more attractive to me over time?” He has stuck to that and been a source of constant affirmation and euphoria ever since. \n\nOf course, the help of medical transition is hard to overstate. I have been on testosterone for about 10 months now and it has been a huge part of why I am able to see myself moving forward through life as a man."
